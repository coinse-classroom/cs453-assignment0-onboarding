## CS453 Assignment 0: GitHub Classroom Onboarding

This is a psuedo-assignment that is designed to get you onboard in GitHub classroom. You need to perform two simple tasks.

- Push an one-line Python program that prints "Hello!"
- Push an one-line text file with your class-related information.

### The Python Program

Your python program should be named `hello.py` and it should print exactly `Hello!` and nothing else (note: no newline). You will get the test results. This is simply to get familiar with reading test results from GitHub Classroom.

### Class-related Information

Your one-line text file should be named `info.txt` and should contain the following, in the comma-separated format:

```
[Your student ID number], [Your full name in English], [Your email address], [Your GitHub ID], [Your Slack ID]
```

The invitation link to the Slack workspace will be sent out by email. Your Slack ID should be `[Your full name in English] ([Your student ID number])` (note the space between your name and the left parenthesis).

### Reminders

- Make sure your submission is in the main branch.
- Allow enough time to push your changes; do not wait until the last minute.
