## CS453 Assignment 0: GitHub Classroom Onboarding

This is a psuedo-assignment that is designed to get you onboard in GitHub classroom. You need to perform two simple tasks.

- Push an one-line Python programm that prints "Hello!"
- Push an one-line text file with your class-related information.
- Push a signed CS Honor code

### The Python Program

Your python program should be named `hello.py` and it should print exactly `Hello!` and nothing else (note: no newline). You will get the test results. This is simply to get familiar with reading test results from GitHub Classroom.

### Class-related Information

Your one-line text file should be named `info.txt` and should contain the following, in the comma-separated format:

```
[Your student ID number], [Your full name in English], [Your email address], [Your GitHub ID], [Your Slack ID]
```

Please use the invitation link on KLMS to join the Slack workspace. Your Slack ID should be `[Your full name in English] ([Your student ID number])` (note the space between your name and the left parenthesis). 

### CS Honor Code

Download the PDF from [here](https://coinse.kaist.ac.kr/assets/files/teaching/cs453/cs453-2021-spring-honor-code.pdf). Fill it it and add signature, either digitally or on paper. Commit and push a pdf file named `[Your student ID]-honor-code-signed.pdf` (if you sign it on a paper, a scan using a phone camera is fine - but make sure it is a PDF file). This should be pushed WITH the `info.txt` file described above (so that we can check the filename).

The grading script only checks the presence of a file with the correct filename, but we will manually check whether you signed. You HAVE to sign the honor code to take this course - otherwise we are not grading your courseworks and exams.
